      The renaming episodes panel consists of an options panel and the files table.<br />
      In the options panel you can check / uncheck all episodes for renaming and you can select the separators between series title and season (season separator),
      the season and the episode number (episode separator) and between the episode and the title (title separator).
      Applying the changes you get a preview of the renaming in the files table.<br />
      The files table has 4 columns
      <ol>
        <li>The id column</li>
        <li>The old name column</li>
        <li>The new name column</li>
        <li>Rename or not the episode (This column is disabled if the new name is the same as the old name)</li>
      </ol>
      After renaming you get a report for the number of files that renamed or not renamed.

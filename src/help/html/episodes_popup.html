             you have provided in [<span class="link">General Options</span>]. 
             The path to the local folder that contains the episodes must be provided in 
             [<span class="link">Add/Edit Series Panel</span>]</li>
           <li><b>Download Episode subtitles</b>If the www.tvsubtitles.net or the www.subtitleonline.com 
             series code is provided (in [<span class="link">Add/Edit Series Panel</span>]) you can search 
             for subtitles in one of these webpages.<br />
             If the primary language (set in [<span class="link">Internet options</span>]) is not found 
             the application will try to download the secondary one. <br />

             file will be extracted there (also renamed according to the renaming options in

             If multiple subtitles are found you will prompt to choose which subtitle to download.<br />
             If downloaded from tvsubtitles.net the users' ratings of the subtitles are provided 
             next to each title to help you avoiding the downloading of wrong/bad subtitle files.<br />
             If the local directory is not provided or direct access to subtitle file is 
             denied by the webpage server the default internet browser will open and download the file.<br />
             You can also move downloaded subtitles (compressed or not) to the Main Series Directory provided 
             in [<span class="link">General Options</span>] and whenever you choose [<span class="link">Update Files</span>]
             from the tools menu the subtitles will be moved to the series directory and renamed (if auto renaming is enabled).
